The main objective of this WebVR experience is to show users the consequences of severe floods. The user will be educated about the 1979 Malta floods. They will see how the events unfolded, and the damage caused. The user will then see how the community responded and what mitigation efforts were used.

The typical user/s of my application would be most of Malta’s population as severe floods would affect everyone were the floods occur.
